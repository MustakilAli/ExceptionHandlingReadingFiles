Checked Exceptions with Reading Files 

important packages in java when it comes to reading and writing to file: 

java.io
java.nio

FileReader fr = new FileReader("Numbers.txt"); //A regular file reader, if the file you are trying to reach is in a separate document- MUST PASTE FILE PATH
BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

================

In my project, I read data from files, and I use File Readers from java.io package. and Because the constructors and methods throw checked exceptions, 
I have to use try/catch blocks in my code. And I always use Finally block to close opened files.
